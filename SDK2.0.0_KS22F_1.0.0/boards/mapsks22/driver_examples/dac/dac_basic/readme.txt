Overview
========

The dac_basic example shows how to use DAC module simply as the general DAC converter.

When the DAC's buffer feature is not enabled, the first item of the buffer is used as the DAC output data register. 
The converter would always output the value of the first item. In this example, it gets the value from terminal, 
outputs the DAC output voltage through DAC output pin.


Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.50.1
- Keil MDK 5.17
- GCC ARM Embedded 2015-4.9-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.0.0
- Atollic TrueSTUDIO 5.4.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- J-Link ARM
- Mini USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The dac_basic_example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial 
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 part jumpers connected

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo. For detailed instructions, see Getting Started with Software Development Kit for 
   KS22F25612 (document SDKKS22F256GSUG).

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.

DAC basic Example.

Please input a value (0 - 4095) to output with DAC: 
Input value is 555
DAC out: 555

Please input a value (0 - 4095) to output with DAC: 
Input value is 333
DAC out: 333

Please input a value (0 - 4095) to output with DAC: 
Input value is 4002
DAC out: 4002

Please input a value (0 - 4095) to output with DAC:
