Overview
========
The TPM project is a simple demonstration program of the SDK TPM driver. It sets up the TPM
hardware block to output PWM signals on two TPM channels. The PWM dutycycle on both channels
is periodically updated. On boards that have an LED connected to the TPM pins, the user will see
a change in LED brightness.

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench 7.50.1
- Keil MDK 5.17
- GCC ARM Embedded 2015-4.9-q3
- Kinetis Development Studio IDE 3.0.0
- Atollic TrueSTUDIO 5.4.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- J-Link ARM
- Mini USB cable
- MAPS-KS22F256 board & MAPS-DOCK board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
The tpm example is configured to use UART1 with PTE0 and PTE1 pins. To make JLink serial 
device work, the jumpers on MAPS-DOCK board should be set as following:
- JP7 on MAPS-Dock: UART0 part jumpers connected
To observe the example result, please connect Pin-53 to Pin-56 on MAPS-KS22F256 board to see LED brightness chang.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a mini USB cable between the PC host and the USB port (CN14) on MAPS-DOCK board.
2. Open a serial terminal on PC for JLink serial device with these settings:
   - 115200 baud rate
   - 8 data bits
   - No parity
   - One stop bit
   - No flow control
3. Download the program to the target board.
4. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running
   the demo. For detailed instructions, see Getting Started with Software Development Kit for 
   KS22F25612 (document SDKKS22F256GSUG).

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, please connect Pin-53 to Pin-56 on MAPS-KS22F256 board to see LED brightness change.
